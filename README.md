# Logos Bible Software MCP Server + Socratic Bible Study Agent

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/), plus a custom Socratic Bible study agent that uses these tools for guided theological dialogue.

## What This Does

- **30 MCP tools** that let Claude read Bible text, search Scripture, navigate Logos, access your notes/highlights/favorites/clippings, check reading plans, explore word studies and factbook entries, search your library catalog, open commentaries and lexicons, run cross-resource searches, capture Logos panels for vision reading, check what Logos is showing, and diagnose environment issues
- **A Socratic Bible Study agent** that guides you through Scripture using questions (not lectures), welcoming any denominational background, with four questioning layers: Observation, Interpretation, Correlation, and Application
- **A QA Tool Tester agent** that systematically exercises all tools and produces a pass/fail/skip report

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **macOS or Windows** | macOS uses the `open` command and AppleScript; Windows uses the registered `logos4:` protocol handler and `tasklist` |
| **Logos Bible Software** | macOS: `/Applications/Logos.app` (tested with v48); Windows: standard install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Logos` |
| **Node.js** | v20+ (better-sqlite3 12 no longer supports Node 18) |
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic's CLI tool ([install guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)) |
| **Biblia API Key** | Free key from [bibliaapi.com](https://bibliaapi.com/) |
| **Xcode Command Line Tools** | `clang` is required to compile the window-capture helper used by `capture_panel_screenshot` (install: `xcode-select --install`) |
| **macOS permissions** | Screen Recording permission for your terminal app (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording) is required for screenshots; Automation/Accessibility permission is prompted on first AppleScript use (detecting whether Logos is running) |

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robrawks/LogosBibleSoftwareMCP.git
cd LogosBibleSoftwareMCP
```

### 2. Install dependencies and build

```bash
cd logos-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### 3. Get a Biblia API key

1. Go to [bibliaapi.com](https://bibliaapi.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Copy your API key

### 4. Create `.mcp.json` in the project root

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logos": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["logos-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BIBLIA_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Create `.env` in the project root (optional, for development)

```
BIBLIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 6. Verify it works

```bash
claude
```

Once Claude Code starts, type `/mcp` to check that the "logos" server appears with 30 tools.

## Using with Claude Desktop or Cowork

The same server can be used with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients. Edit `claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logos": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/you/LogosBibleSoftwareMCP/logos-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BIBLIA_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use an **absolute path** in `args` — relative paths only resolve when the client is launched from the repo root, which is not guaranteed for desktop apps. The same absolute-path rule applies to any MCP client (Claude Code's `.mcp.json` works with relative paths only because it is loaded from the project root).

## Using the Socratic Bible Study Agent

Start Claude Code in the project directory, then:

```
/agent socratic-bible-study
```

The agent will ask what you want to study and guide you through Scripture using the Socratic method. It's tradition-neutral -- it works with any denominational background and presents multiple perspectives where Christians disagree. It guides you through four layers:

1. **Observation** - "What does the text say?"
2. **Interpretation** - "What does the text mean?"
3. **Correlation** - "How does this relate to the rest of Scripture?"
4. **Application** - "What does this mean for us?"

### Example session starters

- "Let's study Romans 8:28-30"
- "I want to do a word study on 'justification'"
- "What does the Bible teach about grace?"
- "Walk me through Psalm 23"

## How It Works

The MCP server integrates with Logos through four channels:

- **Biblia API** - Retrieves Bible text and search results via the free REST API from Faithlife (same company as Logos)
- **URL schemes** - Opens passages, word studies, and factbook entries directly in the Logos app using `logos4:///` URLs (via `open` on macOS, the registered protocol handler on Windows)
- **SQLite databases** - Reads your personal data (notes, highlights, favorites, workflows, reading plans) and library catalog directly from the Logos local database files (read-only access, never modifies your data)
- **Screen capture + vision** - Captures Logos windows so AI can read content displayed in the app UI when direct DB text access is unavailable

## Logos Data Path

The server auto-detects your Logos data by scanning for the per-install instance directory:

```
macOS:    ~/Library/Application Support/Logos4/Documents/<instance-id>/
Windows:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Logos\Documents\<instance-id>\
```

### Reading resource text (macOS)

Logos resource files are encrypted and the reader panel exposes no accessibility tree, so text is read through the app itself: `read_panel_text` drag-selects the visible panel, copies it and returns the text plus the citation Logos attaches; `pages` scrolls and reads several screens (overlaps removed). `read_resource_at` does the whole thing in one call: open a resource at a passage, wait, read. Every "opens the Logos UI" tool (navigate_passage, open_resource, open_guide, search_all, open_word_study, open_factbook) can be followed by `read_panel_text` to get what it opened as text. Requires Accessibility permission for the host app and an uncovered Logos window.

### Your own Logos documents

Four tools read the documents you create in Logos (read-only): `get_sermons` / `get_sermon` (Sermon Builder sermons, rendered as Markdown with headings, bullets, quoted passages and their references, plus series, preaching occasions and tags), `get_reading_plans` (plans with schedule and progress) and `get_passage_lists` (curated reference lists). They live in `Documents/<profile>/Documents/{Sermon,ReadingPlan,PassageList}/`.

### Licensed vs. unlicensed resources

The Logos catalog also lists titles that are only available for purchase or preview. `get_library_catalog` and `get_resource_types` return **licensed resources only** by default (catalog `Availability = 2`, which matches the resource files actually downloaded); pass `licensed_only: false` to include the rest, which are flagged *sin licencia*. Both tools also accept `language` (ISO code such as `es`, `en`, `grc`, `he`).

### Default Bible and Spanish references

Bible-text tools default to the Lexham English Bible (LEB). Set `LOGOS_DEFAULT_BIBLE` in the `env` block to change it (e.g. `"LOGOS_DEFAULT_BIBLE": "RVR60"` for Reina-Valera 1960; run `get_available_bibles` for the codes). References are accepted with English or Spanish book names and common abbreviations (`Romans 8:28`, `Romanos 8:28`, `Ro 8:28`, `1 Co 1:4-9`, `Sal 23`), accents optional.

Each Logos install uses a randomly named instance directory (e.g. `a3wo155q.w14`); detection prefers the directory containing `LibraryCatalog/catalog.db`, so there is no fixed path to configure. If your Logos data lives at a non-standard path, the `LOGOS_DATA_DIR` and `LOGOS_CATALOG_DIR` environment variables remain available as manual overrides (set them in `.mcp.json`). The library catalog lives under `Data/` (not `Documents/`) — set `LOGOS_CATALOG_DIR` if your catalog path differs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logos": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["logos-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BIBLIA_API_KEY": "your_key",
        "LOGOS_DATA_DIR": "/path/to/your/Logos4/Documents/xxxx.w14",
        "LOGOS_CATALOG_DIR": "/path/to/your/Logos4/Data/xxxx.w14"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Quick diagnostic check** - Run `cd logos-mcp-server && npm run diagnose` to verify all data paths, databases, and API configuration before launching Claude Code.

**"BIBLIA_API_KEY is not set"** - Get a free key at [bibliaapi.com](https://bibliaapi.com/) and add it to the `env` block in `.mcp.json`. Bible-text tools need it, but Logos-local tools (notes, highlights, clippings, library catalog) work without it.

**"Database not found"** - Logos isn't installed, or your data is at a non-standard path. Run `find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Logos4 -name "*.db" -maxdepth 5` to locate your databases and set `LOGOS_DATA_DIR`.

**Screenshot tool fails** - Check that your terminal app has Screen Recording permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording) and that Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`).

**Tools don't appear in `/mcp`** - Restart Claude Code. The MCP server is loaded at startup from `.mcp.json`.

**Logos doesn't open passages** - Make sure Logos Bible Software is running before using `navigate_passage`, `open_word_study`, or `open_factbook`.

**Book content is encrypted in local resource files** - Use `capture_panel_screenshot` to let AI read what is visible in Logos, and use `get_clippings` for text you've explicitly clipped/highlighted.
